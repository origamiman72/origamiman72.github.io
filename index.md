   <h1 class="title">Hi! I'm <span class="accent">Abhik Ahuja</span>.</h1>

   <p markdown="1">
   I'm a software engineer at [Zoox](https://zoox.com/) working on 3D reconstruction. I am also finishing my M.Phil studying 3D Computer Vision at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/) under the supervision of [Professor Rafa≈Ç Mantiuk](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rkm38/). I am particularly interested in problems relating to 3D vision and computational photography. Previously, I studied at [UC Berkeley](https://cs.berkeley.edu/) with a double major in Computer Science and Mathematics. There, I worked with [Professor Angjoo Kanazawa](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~kanazawa/) and [Matthew Tancik](https://matthewtancik.com) on visual computing projects such as [Nerfstudio](https://nerf.studio). I have previously interned at Amazon, where I worked on backend infrastructure.

   Aside from computer science, I am also interested in [origami](/origami), [photography](/photography), [Rubik's cubes](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2015AHUJ01), vegan cooking, public transportation, mechanical keyboards, and [more](/other). Feel free to reach out if you want to talk about any of those, or for any other reason!
